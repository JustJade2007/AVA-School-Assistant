1. If sent from a todo list, check off the box once it is confirmed working
2. Add your changes to the changelog once done. (It is in the read me)
    a. the changelog versions should be based off of major changes
    b. If all changes are in one short span, put them into one version. 
    c. 1.2.3.d <- ex
        1. This should ONLY be done if the user says so
        2. This is for MAJOR updates in functionality, for example, when we add a whole new function like the ability for the app to auto select the answers (only change this once per day)
        3. This should be major tweaks or bug fixes (make sure to group these together unless unrelated)
        d. small things that barely count as an update
3. Do NOT merge to main unless explicitly instructed to do so.
4. Any placeholders placeders should be put in the todo as well as where they are and what they do.
